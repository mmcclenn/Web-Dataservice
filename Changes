0.253   2014-12-21

- Added method 'delete_output_field' to remove a field from the output.  This can
  be used by operation methods to remove fields that are determined to be unnecessary.
  This is especially useful for text-format output.
- Fixed a bug that was causing single quotes to be improperly doubled in CSV output.

0.252   2014-11-07 

- You can now specify a summary block for any operation, with the node attribute 'summary'
- This block will be included in the output header, before any records are output
- New request method 'document_summary' to document the list of fields
- New request method 'summary_data' which takes a hash of fields with which the
  block will be filled in.
- You can now specify extended documentation for a node, with the method 'extended_doc'.
  This can be used to specify the documentation that will appear at the top of an
  operation page, without having to create a custom template.
- Added method 'map_value' which transforms a set value to its 'maps_to' value
- The 'set_values' method now throws an exception if given an invalid set name
- Fixed a bug that would wipe out the field lists of configured blocks if one bad
  block name was passed to 'configure_boock'.
