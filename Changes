Revision history for Web-DataService

0.261   2015-06-22

- Documentation nodes are now automatically auto-instantiated if a template file
  exists.  No need to explicitly create a node for each file.
- New Pod directive "=for wds_node ..." sets node attributes, title in particular.  This
  must appear in the first 2048 bytes of the template file.
- Output fields with data_type => 'str' are now quoted in JSON output even if the
  value looks like a number.
- Output records of type 'select' can now have an 'if_block' attribute.
- Auto-generated links now default their link text to the node path without the base.
- Bug fix: output plugin method 'emit_empty' was being called when it shouldn't have been.

0.26    2015-06-17

- Miscellaneous bug fixes:
  - Eliminated unnecessary dependency on $ENV{PWD}, which was causing problems
    because this variable is not always available.
  - URL generation in documentation pages now works properly with Pod format.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing links to be generated incorrectly if the link
    text was '0'.
  - Output block inclusion now works recursively.
  - Output fields with the 'dedup' option set now get a blank value in text output
    records.
  - You can now set 'doc_string' directly when defining set values.

- New request method 'param_keys', which returns a list of keys corresponding
  to the parameters given in this request.
- New request method 'exception', which generates an exception object.  This
  can be passed to die() instead of a string.
- Output plugins now include the method 'emit_empty', which is called if no
  output records were generated.

0.254   2015-03-18

- It is now possible to add aliases for the special parameters.
- In Text format output, the field name "Starting Index" has been replaced by
  "Record Offset".
- The following field names in Text format output no longer are followed by colons:
  "Records Found", "Records Returned", "Elapsed Time".

0.253   2014-12-21

- Added method 'delete_output_field' to remove a field from the output.  This can
  be used by operation methods to remove fields that are determined to be unnecessary.
  This is especially useful for text-format output.
- Fixed a bug that was causing single quotes to be improperly doubled in CSV output.

0.252   2014-11-07 

- You can now specify a summary block for any operation, with the node attribute 'summary'
- This block will be included in the output header, before any records are output
- New request method 'document_summary' to document the list of fields
- New request method 'summary_data' which takes a hash of fields with which the
  block will be filled in.
- You can now specify extended documentation for a node, with the method 'extended_doc'.
  This can be used to specify the documentation that will appear at the top of an
  operation page, without having to create a custom template.
- Added method 'map_value' which transforms a set value to its 'maps_to' value
- The 'set_values' method now throws an exception if given an invalid set name
- Fixed a bug that would wipe out the field lists of configured blocks if one bad
  block name was passed to 'configure_boock'.
