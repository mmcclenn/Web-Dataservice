Web-DataService 0.20

This module provides a framework for you to use in building data service
applications for the World Wide Web.  Such applications sit between a data
storage and retrieval system on one hand and the Web on the other, and fulfill
HTTP-based data requests.  Each valid request is handled by fetching or
storing the appropriate data using the backend data system and serializing the
output in a format such as JSON, CSV, or XML.

Using the methods provided by this module, you start by defining a set of data
service elements: output formats, output blocks, vocabularies, and parameter
rules, followed by a set of data service nodes representing the various
operations to be provided by your service.  Each of these objects is
configured by a set of attributes, optionally including documentation strings.
You continue by writing one or more roles whose methods will handle the
"meat" of each operation: talking to the backend data system to fetch and/or
store the relevant data, based on the parameter values provided in a data
service request.

This module then handles the rest of the work necessary for handling each
request, including checking the parameter values, determining the output
format, and serializing the result.  It also generates appropriate error
messages when necessary.  Finally, it auto-generates documentation pages for
each operation based on the elements you have defined, so that your data
service is always fully and correctly documented.
